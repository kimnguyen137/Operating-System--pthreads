# Operating-System--pthreads
Program writing in C/C++ simulating the enforcement of these restrictions using use of pthreads, pthread mutexes and pthread condition variables.

### SPECIFICATION
This project will familiarize you with the use of pthreads, pthread mutexes and pthread condition variables.

### PROBLEM:
A car tunnel is so poorly ventilated that it has become necessary to restrict:
1. The number of northbound cars in the tunnel,
2. The number of southbound cars in the tunnel,
3. The total number of cars in the tunnel.  
Your assignment is to write a C/C++ simulating the enforcement of these restrictions using Pthread mutexes and condition variables.   
Your program should consist of  
1. A main thread that will fork a tunnel process and the car processes according to the input specifications.
2. One car thread per car wanting to cross the tunnel. The input to your program consists of the maximum number of northbound cars in the tunnel, the maximum number of southbound cars , and the maximum total number of cars in the tunnel followed by an ordered list of arriving cars as in:
```
3 // up to three cars at a time
2 //up to two NB cars at a time
2 //up to two SB cars at a time
1 S 3 // SB car arrives at t = 1s
// will take 3s to go through the tunnel
2 N 4 // northbound car arrives 2s after
// will take 4s to go through the tunnel
1 S 4 // southbound car arrives 1s after
// will take 4s to go through the tunnel
```
Your program will terminate when all cars have gone through the tunnel.

### OUTPUT
Your program should start by echoing the first here lines
of input as in:
Maximum number of cars in the tunnel: 2
Maximum number of northbound cars: 1
Maximum number of southbound cars: 1
It should print one line of output each time a car (a)
arrives at the tunnel, (b) enters the tunnel and (c) leaves
the tunnel. This line of output should identify each car
by its northbound or southbound sequence number as in
Southbound car # 1 arrives at the tunnel.
Southbound car # 1 enters the tunnel.
Northbound car # 1 arrives at the tunnel.
Northbound car # 1 enters the tunnel.
Southbound car # 2 arrives at the tunnel.
Northbound car # 2 arrives at the tunnel.
Southbound car # 1 exits the tunnel.
Southbound car # 2 enters the tunnel.
At the end of the simulation, your program should also
print a summary with the total number of northbound
and southbound cars that went through the tunnel as well
as the total number of cars that had to wait because of
the restrictions.
This summary could look like:
2 northbound car(s) crossed the tunnel.
2 southbound car(s) crossed the tunnel.
2 car(s) had to wait.
PTHREADS
1. Don't forget the pthread include:
#include <pthread.h>
2. All variables that will be shared by all threads must
be declared static as in:
static int MaxNCarsInTunnel;
3. If you want to pass an integer value to your thread
function, you should declare it void as in:
void *car(void *arg) {
int seqNo;
seqNo = (int) arg;
…
} // car
Since most C++ compilers treat the cast of a void
into an int as a fatal error, you must use the flag
‐fpermissive.

4. To start a thread that will execute the customer
function and pass to it an integer value use:
pthread_t tid;
int i;
…
pthread_create(&tid, NULL,
car, (void *) seqNo);
Had you wanted to pass more than one argument
to the car function, you should have put them in
a single array or a single structure.
5. To terminate a given thread from inside the thread
function, use:
pthread_exit((void*) 0);
Otherwise, the thread will terminate with the
function.
6. If you have to terminate another thread function,
you many use:
#include <signal.h>
pthread_kill(pthread_t tid, int sig);
Note that pthread_kill() is a dangerous system
call because its default action is to immediately
terminate the target thread even when it is in a
critical section. The safest alternative to kill a thread
that repeatedly executes a loop is through a shared
variable that is periodically tested by the target
thread.
7. To wait for the completion of a specific thread use:
pthread_join(tid, NULL);
Note that the pthread library has no way to let you
wait for an unspecified thread and do the equivalent
of:
for (i = 0; i < nchildren; i++)
wait(0);
Your main thread will have to keep track of the
thread id’s of all the threads of all the threads it has
created:
pthread_t cartid[maxcars];
for (i = 0; i < TotalNCars; i++)
pthread_join(cartid[i], NULL);
PTHREAD MUTEXES
1. To be accessible from all threads pthread mutexes
must be declared static:
static pthread_mutex_t access;
2. To create a mutex use:
pthread_mutex_init(&access, NULL);
Your mutex will be automatically initialized to
one.
3. To acquire the lock for a given resource, do:
pthread_mutex_lock(&access);
4. To release your lock on the resource, do:
pthread_mutex_unlock(&access);
PTHREAD CONDITION VARIABLES
1. The easiest way to create a condition variable is:
static pthread_cond_t ok =
PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
2. Your condition waits must be preceded by a
successful lock request on the mutex that will be
passed to the wait:
pthread_mutex_lock(&access);
while (ncars > maxNCars)
pthread_cond_wait(&ok, &access);
…
pthread_mutex_unlock(&access);
3. To avoid unpredictable scheduling behavior,
the thread calling pthread_cond_signal()
must own the mutex that the thread calling
pthread_cond_wait() had specified in its call:
pthread_mutex_lock(&access);
…
pthread_cond_signal(&ok);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&access);
All programs passing arguments to a thread must
be compiled with the –fpermissive flag.
Without it, a cast from a void to anything else
will be flagged as an error by some compilers.
